# LiftAlgorithm

This is a project to create a lift simulation.

There are two algorithms that run. The baseline (which only changes the direction in which the lift travels at the top and bottom of the building) and an improved algorithm that I created.

Both algorithms can be demonstarted graphically or run in the background (should the number of floors be too large to show). Either way the results are outputted into a .csv file which allows for the data to be collated.

The final (completed) version of this project can be found under Submission.
